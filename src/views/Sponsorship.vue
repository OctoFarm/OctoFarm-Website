            This project is built by an English bloke in his spare time, around a 9-5 job, to boot.
            If OctoFarm has helped you out at all then I'd be grateful if you could donate towards
            the project. It keeps me going and heck, who doesn't dream of been able to work on their
            passion project daily.

                There are few ways to donate towards the development of OctoFarm. Some have perks and benefits, others do not.

                Massive big thank you to everyone below! Everyone here is on my Tier 4+ Patron or a large donater outside of that.
                You guys help keep me motivated and not let OctoFarm fall by the wayside. Each of you get me a little closer to
                working on this full time as well so you have my warmest regards.
